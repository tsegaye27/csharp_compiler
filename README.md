C# Compiler

Introduction:
This project is a C# compiler implemented using Flex and Bison. It provides a robust framework for lexing, parsing, and analyzing C# code.

Features:
Lexer for tokenizing C# source code.
Parser for generating abstract syntax trees (AST) based on the C# grammar.
Symbol table management for tracking identifiers and tokens.
Error handling and reporting for syntax errors and semantic analysis.
Generation of intermediate representation (IR) code.
Example C# grammar and usage scenarios included.
